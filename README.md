# gpxtr

GPX table translate - extract info from a GPX file to produce markdown data for ride descriptions

Notes:

- This uses GPX routes and waypoints, and does not rely on tracks.
- This produces output in Markdown
- If you set the symbol type for the type of waypoint (e.g. in Basecamp), it will include that in the Notes section and set gas markers as well.
- If you use departure times or layover times in Basecamp, it respects those as well.
- Computes sunrise & sunset based upon start point of route.

Use:

1. Install latest version of python on your system, the executable will be called
   "python" or "python3" -- I'll assume python3/pip3
2. There is a python library installation program, pip3 (or pip) that we use for
   installing the dependencies for this program.
3. `pip3 install https://github.com/pleasantone/gpxtr`
5. `gpxtr` -- should give you the output:

    ```bash
    $ gpxtr
    usage: gpxtr [-h] input [input ...]
    gpxtr: error: the following arguments are required: input
    ```

6. Test it against sample input file, should generate the following output...

    ```text
    $ gpxtr fort-ross.gpx
